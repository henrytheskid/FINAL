        <h1>The Start</h1>
        <label>This is where it all began; this is personal to me.</label>
        <p> My first project took off quickly, reaching over 15,000 followers and earning more than $4,000 in just a week. I was around 13-14 at the time, but I had to shut it down because of age restrictions. Even though it was a setback, I didn't let it stop me.</p>
        <p> Over the past 3-4 years, I have continued to develop my skills in marketing and sales. I am now eager to leverage this experience to start my own venture and apply these skills to assist companies through internships and professional roles.</p>

        <h1>Past Projects</h1>
        <label>During my freshman and sophomore years, I was dedicated to building a presence on social media. I successfully grew a new TikTok page to over 100,000 followers organically. Throughout this journey, I attracted several sponsors who paid for promotional marketing of their brands.</label>

            <h2>Additional Work</h2>
            <p>Throughout high school, I spent hours online networking and learning a bit of coding. I have created projects using Python, Java, and CSS. While I wouldn’t call myself a professional coder, I can build websites and tools by researching and utilizing various online resources. You can explore some of my projects on my GitHub profile:</p>

            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>This website was created during a random day of summer break, reflecting a day's worth of work. While it's a simple project, it serves as a showcase of some of my work and provides insights into my interests and background.</p>
            <p>I have a strong passion for sales and marketing and am driven by opportunities where I can engage deeply with these fields. My ideal job is one that aligns with this passion—whether as a coder or a marketer. I find immense satisfaction in working on projects that I would gladly do for free, as they genuinely interest me.</p>
            <p>The projects displayed here are accomplishments from my high school years, demonstrating my commitment and skills in these areas. As of August 2024, I am 17 years old, and I am eager to continue developing my expertise and pursuing opportunities in sales, marketing, and coding.</p>
